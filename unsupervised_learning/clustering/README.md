# Clustering

This directory contains projects focused on clustering algorithms and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Tasks

### 0. Initialize K-means
Write a function that initializes cluster centroids for K-means clustering using a multivariate uniform distribution.

**File:** `0-initialize.py`

### 1. K-means
Write a function that performs K-means clustering on a dataset with automatic convergence detection and empty cluster reinitialization.

**File:** `1-kmeans.py`

### 2. Variance
Write a function that calculates the total intra-cluster variance within a data set.

**File:** `2-variance.py`

### 3. Optimize k
Write a function that tests the optimum number of clusters by variance to find the best k value.

**File:** `3-optimum.py`

### 4. Initialize GMM
Write a function that initializes variables for a Gaussian Mixture Model with priors, means, and covariance matrices.

**File:** `4-initialize.py`

### 5. PDF
Write a function that calculates the probability density function of a Gaussian distribution.

**File:** `5-pdf.py`
